# Cache Simulator
 This program simulates a memory cache based on a source file provided to it. It prints a report based on its activity. The simulation uses an [LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)).
 
 **Note:** This program requires the C++ Boost library to compile.
